# How to give course content access to staff members

As a course owner, you can give access to your entire course space to other staff members. This is often used when you have multiple instructors teaching the same course (different sections and/or different terms).

* From your course page, go to the `Staff` tab (you can go to the course page by clicking the course name from the top bar menu).

* Click the `Add user` button. Enter the UID (the user ID or username) for the user you are trying to add. In many cases, the UID is the user email. Click `Add user` to confirm. You will see the user added to the `Staff` page.

* Use the dropdown toggle that says `None` in the column `Course content access` to select the desired permission level.

The options `Owner` and `Editor` are often given to course instructors. If you have teaching assistants who are assisting with course development, you can add them using the `Editor` permission.

You can read more about all the different permissions from the [Staff](Instructor/references/staff.md) reference page.

Note that giving course content access does not provide [access to student data](Instructors/HowTos/Staff/studentDataAccess.md).
