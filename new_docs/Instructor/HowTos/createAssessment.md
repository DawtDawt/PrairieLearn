# How to create a new assessment

* From the toggle dropdown at the top bar menu, select the desired course instance. By default, this will take you to the `Assessments` page of that course instance.

* Click the `Add assessment` button. You will be automatically directed to the `Settings` tab for the new assessment.

* Click the button `Change AID` to change the assessment ID name. In general, we use names such as `Homework1` or `Exam5`. After changing the AID, click `Change` to save.

* To change the assessment configuration in the `infoAssessment.json` file,  click the `Edit` button.

* Modify the assessment title by updating the string in `title`, for example `Homework 5: boolean logic`.

* Click `Save and sync`.

* Navigate back to the Assessments page by clicking `Assessments` from the top bar menu. You should see your assessment list, including the newly created assessment.

PrairieLearn has two [assessment types](../references/assessment.md#assessment-types): `Homework` and `Exam`, and the default is set to `Homework`. The main different between these two types is the grading method.
