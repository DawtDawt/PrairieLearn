# How to give student data access to staff members

As a course owner, you can give staff members access to student data at the course instance level.
For example, you can give a teaching assistant permission to see all the assessments for a specific course instance and the ability to manually modify students's scores when needed, without giving them access to modify course content. They also will not be able to see student grades in other course instances.


* From your course page, go to the `Staff` tab (you can go to the course page by clicking the course name from the top bar menu).

* Click the `Add user` button. Enter the UID (the user ID or username) for the user you are trying to add. In many cases, the UID is the user email. Click `Add user` to confirm. You will see the user added to the `Staff` page.

* If the user already has course content access, you should skip the step above. Instead, find their name in the `Staff` page to setup the student data access.

* Use the dropdown toggle that says `Add` in the column `Student data access` to select the course instance. By default, the user will receive `Viewer` access to student data. You can use the dropdown toggle to change it to `Editor`.

You can read more about these permissions from the [Staff](../references/staff.md) reference page.
