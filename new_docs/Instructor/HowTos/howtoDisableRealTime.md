## Disabling real-time grading

PrairieLearn is designed to give students immediate feedback on their work. However, if you wish to more closely replicate a paper exam experience, you can prevent students from grading their work as they go (what we call "real-time grading").

*Note that students generally expect and benefit from having immediate feedback, so this setting should only be enabled if you have a specific reason for it.*

To disable real-time grading for an assessment, add `"allowRealTimeGrading": false` to the assessment's `infoAssessment.json` file. This will hide the "Save & Grade" button on student question pages; only the "Save" button will be available. The "Grade saved answers" button on the assessment overview will also be hidden. Note that real-time grading can only be disabled for `Exam` assessments, as immediate feedback is a core part of the `Homework` experience.

An assessment without real-time grading will not show any score information during the exam. However, if a [time limit](accessControl.md#time-limits) is used then when it runs out the assessment will auto-grade and show students exactly which questions they got correct/incorrect. The same revealing behavior will happen if an instructor manually closes and grades the student assessment. To prevent this, set the [`showClosedAssessment` access rule restriction](accessControl.md#showinghiding-closed-assessments).

Disabling real-time grading changes a lot of fundamental details of how PrairieLearn is used. To account for that, the student assessment overview page displays less information about points and grading than for usual exams.

Here is the assessment page for a normal exam with real-time grading enabled:

Here is the assessment page for an open exam with real-time grading disabled:

Compared to the normal assessment, there are a number of differences:

* A warning explaining that real-time grading has been disabled is shown
* Total points is listed as a number, not as an "X/Y" score
* The percentage bar is not displayed
* The "Best submission" column is renamed to "Submission status"
* The "Available points" column has been removed
* The "Awarded points" column has been renamed to "Points" and only shows the max points

Here is the assessment page for a closed exam with real-time grading disabled:

Note that after the exam has closed and been graded, more information about points will be visible.
