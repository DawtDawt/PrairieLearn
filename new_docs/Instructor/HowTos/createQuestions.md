# How to create a new question

You can create a new question using the PrairieLearn template, or using another question from your own course:

  1. If you want to create a question using the PrairieLearn default template:

    * Go to the `Questions` tab from the top bar menu.

    * Click the button `Add Question` on the Question page.

    * You will be automatically directed to the `Settings` tab for the new question.


  2. If you want to create a question from an existing one inside your course:

    * From the `Questions` tab, select the question you want to duplicate.

    * Go to the `Settings` tab, and click the button `Make a copy of this question`. Click `Submit` to make a copy of the question inside your own course.

    * You will be automatically directed to the `Settings` tab for the copied question.


  3. Update the question settings:

    * Click the button `Change QID` to change the question ID name. After changing the QID, click `Change` to save.

    * To change the question configuration in the `info.json` file,  click the `Edit` button.

    * Modify the question title by updating the string in `title`, for example `Compute the division of two numbers`.

    * You may want to modify the [`topic`](../references/course.md#topics) and [`tags`](../references/course.md#tags) properties.

    * Click `Save and sync`.

    * Go to the `Preview` tab to see the question.


  4. Edit the newly created question

    * Navigate to the `Files` tab. To modify the question text, click `Edit` next to `question.html`.

    * Make your changes and click `Save and sync`.  

    * Go back to `Preview` tab to see how your question looks like.

    * Navigate to the `Files` tab. To modify the file that provides backend support for the question, click `Edit` next to `server.py`.

    * Make your changes and click `Save and sync`.  

    * Go back to `Preview` tab to see how your question looks like.
