# How to create a new course instance

A course instance corresponds to a single offering of a course, such as "Fall 2020", or possibly "Fall 2020, Section M".

* Go to the `Course Instances` page by selecting the corresponding tab below the top bar menu.

* Click the button `Add course instance`. You will be automatically directed to the new instance `Settings` tab.

* Click the button `Change CIID` to change the course instance ID name. Typically we recommend using a short version of the course instance name, for example `Fa21`.  After changing the CIID, click `Change` to save.

* To change the course configuration settings in the `infoCourseInstance.json` file,  click the `Edit` button.

* Modify the full name of your course instance by updating the string in `longName`, for example `Fall 2021 - online section`.

* Click `Save and sync`.

* Navigate back to your course space by clicking the course short name from the top bar menu. You should see the new course instance listed in the `Course Instance` page.

Note that you can change between course instances by selecting links from the `Course Instances` page, or using the dropdown toggle at the top bar menu.
