# How to make a copy of an existing course instance

If you are teaching the same course in multiple terms (or multiple sections in the same term), you can easily make a copy of your entire course instance.

* From the toggle dropdown at the top bar menu, select the course instance you would like to duplicate. Note you can do the same from the Course Instances page.

* Navigate to the `Settings` tab and click `Make a copy of this course instance`. A copy will be made, and you will be taken to the `Settings` tab of this new copied instance.  

* Click `Change CIID` to change the course instance ID name.

* To change the course configuration settings in the `infoCourseInstance.json` file,  click the `Edit` button.

* Modify the full name of your course instance by updating the string in `longName`, for example `Spring 2022`.

* You will need to adjust `allowAccess` to change the start and end dates of the course instance.

* Click `Save and sync`.

* Navigate back to your course space by clicking the course short name from the top bar menu. You should see the new course instance listed in the `Course Instance` page.
