# How to upload files to my course

You may want to add the same document to different assessments (for example, cheatsheets). Instead of uploading the document to each assessment folder, you may consider uploading the document:

- for the entire course
- for the entire course instance

#### Upload a file to be available for the entire course

To upload a file to `clientFilesCourse`:

* Go to the main course page, by clicking your course name on the top bar menu.

* Go to the `Files` tab.

* Click the button `Add new client file`

* Browse the file you want to upload. Click `Upload file`. The file will be uploaded to the folder `clientFilesCourse` (which will be created the first time you perform this task).

#### Upload a file to be available for the entire course instance

To upload a file to `clientFilesCourseInstance`:

* Go to the main course page, by clicking your course name on the top bar menu.

* Go to the desirable course instance.

* Go to the `Files` tab.

* Click the button `Add new client file`

* Browse the file you want to upload. Click `Upload file`. The file will be uploaded to the folder `clientFilesCourseInstance` (which will be created the first time you perform this task).


#### Upload a file to be available only for an specific assessment

To upload a file to `clientFilesAssessment`:

* Go to the main course page, by clicking your course name on the top bar menu.

* Go to the desirable course instance.

* Go to the desirable assessment.

* Go to the `Files` tab.

* Click the button `Add new client file`

* Browse the file you want to upload. Click `Upload file`. The file will be uploaded to the folder `clientFilesAssessment` (which will be created the first time you perform this task).
