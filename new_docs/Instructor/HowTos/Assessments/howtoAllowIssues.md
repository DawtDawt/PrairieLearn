## Issue reporting

To allow students to report issues with questions (incorrect answers, unclear wording, etc), set the `"allowIssueReporting": true` property in the `infoAssessment.json` file, or set it to `false` to disallow reporting. This option defaults to `true`.

When issue reporting is allowed, students see a button labeled "Report an error in this question" and they can submit a short text form.

Course staff see any reported issues show up on the "Issues" tab.
